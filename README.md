# Airflow test

You can use tf-airflow, to create empty Docker/Podman image that has only Python3 and Openssh-Server installed. Into that container you can install Apache Airflow with given Ansible playbook. This solution is really basic just to try Airflow real quick. For production environment please refer to offical documentation.
